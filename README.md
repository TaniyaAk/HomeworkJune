BERKSHIRE HATHWAY CL A





Recommendation today is to SELL!!!!!!!!!!!!





The main reason why Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock is priced so high is that the company didn't decide to split its stock.

 As a result, the price of each share has risen along with the immense growth of the holding company over the past decades and is now the most 'expensive' publicly trading stock.
